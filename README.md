# `sign`’s dotfiles

## Installation

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/dotfiles`.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sign/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
```
